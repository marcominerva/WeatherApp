# Weather App

A collection of applications that show how to leverage .NET 5.0 features like HostBuilder, ServiceProvider, Logging (using [Serilog](https://github.com/serilog/serilog)) and Cache on every supported platform:

* ASP.NET Core
* WPF
* Windows Forms
* Xamarin

All the examples use [Refit](https://github.com/reactiveui/refit) to call [OpenWeatherMap APIs](https://openweathermap.org/api). To run them, you need to register a free account on [OpenWeatherMap](https://home.openweathermap.org), create an [API key](https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys) and then insert it in the *appsettings.json* file of the projects.
